  Next up:
  - List up all the settings that can be done quickly, and design the settings panel.

  To-do now:
  - Update quickly.nestyourcss.com to use the new background (with clip method)
  - Style .ace_search
  - Area to drop in files
  - Ability to send a link of a CSS file
  - Button to clear the code (could just CTRL+A & Backspace)
  - Show list of errors, and a button to jump to them
  - Button to add samples of CSS
  - Show the file size of both CSS outputs
  - Send the Nested output to a raw file
  - Change indentation setting
  - Mention "it's recommended to use diff, and add in the old CSS selectors to the new" (because this tool also reformats your code and removes comments)
  - Update the nesting functionality to fix cssSamples[0] - @page

  List of (potential) parts to add to the site:
  - History of all conversions to Nested CSS >> Auto-save every minute? Or just "Nest" button (probably both, but auto-save is toggleable)
  - Button to use the previous selector instead (a.k.a. previous diff, but only for selectors)
  - Paredit may be useful
  - Keyboard Shortcuts extension has a lot of useful stuff, will have to "re-develop" to: limit what features are possible and re-design.
  - Add a minimap, might have to DIY
  - Sticky Scroll - Official Ace Extensions (DIY)
  - Add like a Table of Contents page, like Figma's Layers component for all the nested selectors
  - Add an anti-adblock background, along with the border

  Later:
  - Full revamp
  - Design the nesting editors, similar to Google Docs - centred editors (toolbar on the top)
  - Making the nesting settings area have a fixed width and centre the editors within the nesting area
  - Implement locomotive scroll or some other momentum scroll plugin (https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll)
  - Information on how to (manually) Nest your CSS
  - Add AceDiff
  - Change modes from light to dark modes
  - Section input both HTML and CSS code and to display Nested CSS output
  - Allow comments >> Might require a code revamp
  - Ability to nest multiple CSS files at the same time
  - Option to allow emmet?

  Code to go to specific line:
    // Assuming 'editor' is your Ace Editor instance
    var lineNumber = 10; // Replace with your desired line number

    // Get the content of the line
    var lineContent = editor.session.getLine(lineNumber - 1); // Ace Editor uses 0-based index

    // Scroll to the line
    editor.scrollToLine(lineNumber, true, true, function () {});

    // Optionally, highlight the line
    editor.gotoLine(lineNumber, 0, true);

    console.log("Line Content: ", lineContent);

            This means
