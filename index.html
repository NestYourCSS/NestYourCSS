    List of (potential) parts to add to the site:

    - History of all conversions to Nested CSS
    - Section to input CSS code and to display Nested CSS output
    - Section input both HTML and CSS code and to display Nested CSS output
    - Change modes from light to dark modes
    - Replace some of the changed, nested CSS with the original CSS (through AceDiff).
    - Area to drop in files
    - Ability to send a link of a CSS file
    - Button to clear the code (could just CTRL+A & Backspace)
    - Button to convert the code
    - Information about why you should 'Nest your CSS'
    - Information on how to (manually) Nest your CSS
    - Button to add sample CSS
    - Ability to nest multiple CSS files at the same time
    - Ability to auto-nest the CSS code
    - Show the file size of both CSS outputs
    - Send the Nested output to a raw file
    - Button to use the previous selector instead (a.k.a. previous diff, but only for selectors)
    - Mention it's recommended to use diff and add in the old CSS selectors to the new

    To-do now:
    - When re-nesting, check if the parent only has one child, if so don't go to another indentation, so we don't end up with rules which only have a single nested rule within them and no self-declarations.
    - Use Monaco Editor, as opposed to ace (refer: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63179813/how-to-run-the-monaco-editor-from-a-cdn-like-cdnjs>).
