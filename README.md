An Awwwards-inspired online converter tool to minify, beautify, denest, and nest CSS code according to the latest CSS specs. Originally created as a [personal portfolio project](https://github.com/TimChinye/NestYourCSS), it has since evolved into a well-rounded, publicly open-source tool for the modern front-end developer.

## About The Project

With the arrival of the native CSS Nesting module, there was a clear need for a simple, pure CSS converter. The available tools were often CSS-to-SCSS converters that produced code requiring significant manual cleanup.

**Nest Your CSS was created to fill that gap.**

The project began with a simple goal: create a reliable A-to-B converter. This goal expanded into a mission to build a portfolio-worthy, "Awwwards-level" application that champions high-quality user experience, accessibility, and modern web standards.

The result is [`nestyourcss.com`](https://nestyourcss.com/), a free, open-source tool with no backend and no sign-up required, now maintained as a public, open-source application.

## Built With

This project is a testament to the power of web fundamentals, built with **zero frameworks**.

-   HTML5 (Semantic & ARIA-enhanced)
-   CSS3 (Utilizing modern features like `@layer`, Container Queries, and Relative Color Syntax)
-   Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
-   [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/) for the code editing experience
-   [Lenis](https://lenis.studiofreight.com/) for smooth scrolling effects

## Features

-   **Nest CSS:** Convert standard CSS to the latest native nested syntax.
-   **De-nest CSS:** Flatten nested CSS back to standard, browser-compatible CSS.
-   **Minify CSS:** Optimize your stylesheets by removing unnecessary characters.
-   **Beautify CSS:** Format and indent your code for maximum readability and maintainability.
-   **Customizable Editor:** Adjust font, font size, indentation, and word wrap to your preference.
-   **Load External CSS:** Fetch and convert stylesheets directly from a URL.
-   **Deep Accessibility:** Fully navigable and usable with screen readers, thanks to extensive ARIA implementation.
-   **Awwwards-Inspired UI/UX:** A focus on smooth animations, visual appeal, and a high-quality user experience.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running for development or contribution, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
-   You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation & Production Build

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NestYourCSS/NestYourCSS.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd NestYourCSS
    ```
3.  Install NPM packages and build the project for production:
    ```sh
    npm install && npm run build
    ```
4.  This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized production files. Open `dist/index.html` in your browser to run the live version locally.

#### Development Mode

If you simply want to view the raw, `in-development` files without running the build process, you can open the `index.html` file in the root directory directly in your browser after cloning. Note that some features may behave differently than in the production build.
